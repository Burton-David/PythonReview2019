    "Computers are able to make billions of calculations per a second.  However, computers only understand machine language.  Machine language is binary or hexadecimal instructions which a computer can respond to directly.  And when I began my journey towards becoming a data scientist I was told that all I really need to know about machine language as a data scientist is that it exists, and to focus on learning a higher level language.  But, as somebody who loves to learn languages and has learned to speak quite a few, this introduction to programming annoyed me.\n",

    "Language is so much more than words.  Language is developed to fill essential needs within a society.  Language is how internal thoughts are thought.  Languages are given style based upon personality, necessities and function.  An understanding of a language is the foundation to understanding the culture which speaks that language.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if you want to understand computers it is essential to have a basic understanding of a computer's native language.  Thankfully, this is an easy lesson.  There isn't really a whole lot to computers.  They are a bunch of circuits that can be either on or off.  It a language that has only 2 unique words, zero or one, and is communicated as a \"bit\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To communicate with computers we use higher level languages such as Python.  A compiler translates the higher level language into the machine language (binary). \n",
    "\n",
    "Every higher level language has a trade-off.  Performance vs Production.  C is an extremely high performing language; however, it is labor intensive to write programs in C and therefore almost never used.  Most, opt for languages such as Java and Python when developing software.  These languages trade off a little bit of performance for the ability to be written and maintained easily.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Certain languages do better for certain applications.  Python is a great general purpose language that is used frequently with data applications and therefore it is used a lot by data scientists.  "
